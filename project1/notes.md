Task 1 : Postgresql
	 A Database is an essential part for storing the data of an application.
	 Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.
	 It provides free database service which can store upto 10,000 records.


Task 2 : Python and Flask
	 Flask is a lightweight web application framework written in Python.
	 The main issue which I faced during running of flask is with 'werkzeug.contrib' module.
	 By researching about this error, I found that 'werkzeug' module is to be downgraded.
	 So, first I uninstalled 'werkzeug' and reinstalled the older version of 'werkzeug' (version 1.0.0 to version 0.16.0)
	 

Task 3 : Goodreads API
	 This API allows us to use the API with the help of the Key provided.
	 The Key here works as an authentication such that the data from the Goodreads API is sent to the 
	 authorized user only.
